# Chat Application

A real-time chat application built with Go and WebSockets.

## Choosing between WebSockets and SSE

>Use WebSockets when:
- You need bi-directional communication.
- You require low latency and efficient communication.
>Use SSE when:
- You only need to push updates from the server to the client.
- You want a simpler implementation.
