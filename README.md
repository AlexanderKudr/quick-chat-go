# Chat Application

>Use WebSockets when:
- You need bi-directional communication.
- You require low latency and efficient communication.
- Supports binary data
- Better suited for live updates/games
>Use SSE when:
- You only need to push updates from the server to the client/or from client to server. But you can do chats as i did here.
- You want a simpler implementation.
- You want auto reconnections
- More secure by default
